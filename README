To use this test suite in a BioCro source tree:

1. Clone this repository as a subdirectory of the root directory of the source tree:

   cd <root of BioCro module source tree>
   git clone git@github.com:gsrohde/BioCroCppTests.git

2. CD to the repository root and initialize and recursively update its
   submodule:

   cd BioCroCppTests
   git submodule update --init --recursive

3. Compile the testBML module library by installing the R pacakge:

   cd testBML
   R CMD INSTALL .

[To-Do: Add a Make file to the testBML src directory that will make
testBML.so without installing the corresponding R package.]

4. Make the tests and run them:

   cd ..
   make

The command *make* will both compile the tests and then run them.
Once the tests are compiled, you can also run them directly with the
command

     ./test_all

This allows for the use of various GoogleTest test-running options.
For example,

     ./test_all --gtest_also_run_disabled_tests

will run the tests that are currently disabled (and that will currently fail).
